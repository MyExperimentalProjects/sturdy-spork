## HashMap

Lets take a dictionary, and try to find the word zebra. 
We can easily guess that zebras will be near the end of the book, just like the letter "Z" is at the end of the alphabet. 
Now lets say that we can always find where the zebra is inside of the dictionary. This is the way that we can quickly find zebras, or elephants, or any other word in the dictionary. 

Sometimes two words will be on the same page like apple and ape. We are sure which page we want to look at, but we aren't sure how close apple and ape are to each other until we get to the page. Sometimes apple and ape can be on the same page and sometimes they might not be, some dictionaries have more words.
